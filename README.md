Data Types implemented in C
===========================

Using
-----

Each data type has its own markdown file to explain its usage. 
If you want to include all data types use the `data_types.h` header.

Since each data type is only a `.c` and `.h` file, you can simply copy/paste it into your project.
Alternatively, if you're using a build automation tool you can include the directory and all associated files.

Contributing
------------

If you want to add another data type or function for any of the existing data types feel free to create a pull request.
I will most likely merge the pull request if it fits with the rest of the project (same syntax conventions, updated markdowns, etc.)
